## Leadership Strategy and Tactics

by Jocko Willink

#### Introduction: The Roots of Learning Leadership

* The goal of leadership is simple: To get people to do what they need to do to support the mission and the team.
* What makes leadership so hard is dealing with people, and people are crazy. Everyone has their own characteristics, personalities, and perspectives.
* One of the underlying themes of SEAL Team culture is you can never rest on what you have achieved in the past. You always have to improve.

### Part 1: Leadership Strategies

#### Section 1: Foundations

##### First Platoon: Detach

* Do not get caught up in the miniscule tactics of a problem. Instead get a higher mental altitude to see more. This is called *detachment*.
* First, be aware. Pay attention to yourself and what's around you, and ensure you don't get absorbed in the minute details of any situation.
* Lift your chin up and look around. Then take a deep breath and exhale. This cues you to do the same thing mentally.

##### Second Platoon: Arrogance and Humility

* Decentralized Command is telling people what needs to get done, and then having those people figure out how to do it.
* Someone who executes on his or her plan instead of your plan is already bought in, already completely committed to making it a success.
* Showing humility, and not looking down on someone, instills respect and encourages that person to follow you.

##### Third Platoon: Overstepping my Bounds

* You don't need to be at the center of decision making. Your job is to support the team and the mission, which may mean supporting the boss.
* Don't jockey for position and maneuver against one another rather than maneuvering against the enemy.
* Subordinating your ego to the mission and to the boss does not mean you are weak. It means you put the team and the mission above yourself so that you can win.

##### Laws of Combat and Principles of Leadership

* Jocko's Laws of Combat: 1) cover and move; 2) simple; 3) prioritize and execute; 4) decentralized command.
* Cover and move is two teams working together to make progress. A unit in the field by itself is a fraction of what it is when it has another unit supporting it.
* Simple means a clear goal, and communicating plans and directives up and down the chain of command in a simple, concise manner that is universally understood.
* Prioritize and execute means if team members try to accomplish too many things at once, they will likely accomplish nothing.
* Once the other laws are implemented, then decentralized command can be utilized, where everyone on the team can step up and lead.
* Extreme Ownership means not making excuses or blaming anyone or anything when problems occur. You must take ownership to solve problems and improve teams.
* The Dichotomy of Leadership says any trait, technique, or attitude can easily go too far in one direction or another. To lead properly, a leader must be balanced.
