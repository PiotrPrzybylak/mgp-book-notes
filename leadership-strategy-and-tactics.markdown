## Leadership Strategy and Tactics

by Jocko Willink

#### Introduction: The Roots of Learning Leadership

* The goal of leadership is simple: To get people to do what they need to do to support the mission and the team.
* What makes leadership so hard is dealing with people, and people are crazy. Everyone has their own characteristics, personalities, and perspectives.
* One of the underlying themes of SEAL Team culture is you can never rest on what you have achieved in the past. You always have to improve.

### Part 1: Leadership Strategies

#### Section 1: Foundations

##### First Platoon: Detach

* Do not get caught up in the miniscule tactics of a problem. Instead get a higher mental altitude to see more. This is called *detachment*.
* First, be aware. Pay attention to yourself and what's around you, and ensure you don't get absorbed in the minute details of any situation.
* Lift your chin up and look around. Then take a deep breath and exhale. This cues you to do the same thing mentally.

##### Second Platoon: Arrogance and Humility

* Decentralized Command is telling people what needs to get done, and then having those people figure out how to do it.
* Someone who executes on his or her plan instead of your plan is already bought in, already completely committed to making it a success.
* Showing humility, and not looking down on someone, instills respect and encourages that person to follow you.

##### Third Platoon: Overstepping my Bounds

* You don't need to be at the center of decision making. Your job is to support the team and the mission, which may mean supporting the boss.
* Don't jockey for position and maneuver against one another rather than maneuvering against the enemy.
* Subordinating your ego to the mission and to the boss does not mean you are weak. It means you put the team and the mission above yourself so that you can win.

##### Laws of Combat and Principles of Leadership

* Jocko's Laws of Combat: 1) cover and move; 2) simple; 3) prioritize and execute; 4) decentralized command.
* Cover and move is two teams working together to make progress. A unit in the field by itself is a fraction of what it is when it has another unit supporting it.
* Simple means a clear goal, and communicating plans and directives up and down the chain of command in a simple, concise manner that is universally understood.
* Prioritize and execute means if team members try to accomplish too many things at once, they will likely accomplish nothing.
* Once the other laws are implemented, then decentralized command can be utilized, where everyone on the team can step up and lead.
* Extreme Ownership means not making excuses or blaming anyone or anything when problems occur. You must take ownership to solve problems and improve teams.
* The Dichotomy of Leadership says any trait, technique, or attitude can easily go too far in one direction or another. To lead properly, a leader must be balanced.

##### The Power of Relationships

* The better the relationships, the more open and effective communication is. The more communication there is, the stronger the team will be.
* Don't build a relationship with your boss to garner favor from them. Build one so your boss trusts you and so you and the team can more effectively accomplish the mission.
* Complete the tasks expected by your boss on time, on budget, and with little drama. Over time your boss will know you're the person who makes things happen.
* Make things happen, so when you raise an objection your boss knows it is founded on solid facts that should be considered.
* If you don't raise any objections with your boss over something that makes no sense, your team will recognize your failure to speak up.

##### Play the Game

* Burning bridges and leaving scorched earth in your wake destroys everything for short-term gain.
* Play the game and support your boss, to build trust and a relationship. Not for your personal gain, but to better accomplish the mission.
* If a subordinate objects to your approach and presents an alternative, listen and say yes as much as you can to build trust with them.
* This isn't manipulation – the goal is to actually support your boss. A collateral benefit is that you build the relationship.

##### When is Mutiny in Order?

* Disobeying a boss causes disruption to the team, sets back progress, and may result in mission failure and disintegration of the team.
* If a leader is asking the team to do something that is illegal, immoral, or unethical, then you must report it up the chain of command.
* If the leader is leading the team in a direction that results in catastrophic failure, then disobeying the leader may be required.
* Before making a last stand, attempt to understand the boss one last time. You may miss some details he or she sees at a higher altitude.
* Ideally a subordinate presents the boss not only his or her concerns but a solution to the problem.
* Don't present objections in an offensive manner. Doing so makes your argument sound emotional instead of logical, and attacking the boss causes them to dig in.
* It's better for a subordinate to ask questions that puts the fault on themselves, saying they lack the understanding or experience of the boss.
* Don't pit your idea against the boss's idea. Root your ideas back to the boss so the idea is tied directly to them, because most people like their own ideas best.
* If the leader does not change his or her plan:
  * The leader can stick to the plan and replace the subordinate with someone more obedient, but the team will suffer because the voice of reason is gone.
  * The subordinate can refuse to execute the plan or quit in protest, but after making this statement there is nothing more the subordinate can do.
  * The subordinate can follow through, mitigating the negative impacts of the poor plan, noting the harmful effects so that they can be explained clearly, and continuing to build a relationship with the boss for better outcomes going forward. But the subordinate is still culpable for the outcome.
