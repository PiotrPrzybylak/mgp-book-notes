## Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track

by Will Larson

### Overview

* At the career level, being promoted further is an exception rather than expected.

#### Staff Engineer Archetypes

* The four common archetypes are the _Tech Lead_, the _Architect_, the _Solver_, and the _Right Hand_.
* A _Tech Lead Manager_ is similar to the Tech Lead archetype but exists on the engineering management ladder and includes people management responsibilities.

##### Tech Lead

* Tech Leads are the most common archetype. They're comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way.
* They maintain many essential cross-team and cross-functional relationships, and are a close partner to the team's product manager.
* A tech lead defaults to delegating tasks, thereby growing their teammates, but they still define the team's technical vision and step in to build alignment on technical issues.
* An organization needs roughly one tech lead for every eight engineers, and so they are the most common archetype.
* A Staff-engineer is the intersection of your role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization's recognition of all these things.

##### Architect

* Architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company.
* For a domain to merit an architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company's success.
* Influential architects dedicate their energy to maintaining and intimate understanding of the business' needs, the users' goals, and the relevant technical constraints.
* The architect role emerges in large companies, those with extremely complex codebases, and in companies struggling to repay technical debt created in their sprint to product-market fit.

##### Solver

* The Solver is a trusted agent of the company who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they're resolved.
* They generally stop working on problems once they're contained, which creates a feeling of transience and requires a soft touch to avoid upsetting the teams left to maintain the "solved" problem.
* The solver is most common in companies that think of individuals, rather than teams, as the atomic unit of planning and ownership.

##### Right Hand

* The Right Hand is the least common of the archetypes, showing up as an organization reaches hundreds of engineers. They operate as a senior organizational leader without direct managerial responsibilities.
* Borrowing authority comes with the obligation to remain deeply aligned with that leader's approach, beliefs, and values.
* Problems addressed at this level are never purely technical and instead involve the intersection of business, technology, people, culture, and process.
* The joy of these roles is that you work only on essential problems. The tragedy is that you're on to the next issue by the time those problems are solved.

##### Which is right for you?

* Success in these roles requires remaining engaged, so it's essential to understand what kind of work energizes you.
* The Tech Lead and Architect may work with the same people and on the same problem for years, developing a tight sense of team and shared purpose.
* The Solver and Right Hand bounce from fire to fire, often having only transactional interactions with the folks they're working with on any given week.

#### What do Staff engineers actually do?

* All archetypes set and edit technical direction, provide sponsorship and mentorship, inject engineering context into organizational decisions, exploration, and be glue.

##### Setting technical direction

* Think of setting technical direction as being a part-time product manager for technology.
* Setting technical direction is far more about understanding and solving the real needs of the organization around you and far less about prioritizing technology approaches that you're personally excited to learn about.

##### Mentorship and sponsorship

* You're far more likely to change your company's long term trajectory by growing other engineers than through personal heroics.
* The most effective Staff engineers pair a moderate amount of mentorship with considerably more sponsorship.

##### Providing engineering perspective

* Staff-plus engineers are the folks who will often get unexpectedly pulled into the room when time-sensitive or important decisions are happening.
* Such brief moments of input on critical decisions are unduly impactful and will allow you to inject an engineering perspective where it would otherwise be missed.

##### Exploration

* Staff-engineers may be assigned to do exploratory work, which is any ambiguous, important problem that the company's systems are ill-shaped to address.
* It takes a great deal of organizational trust to be trusted with this work, including having enough respect from the business that if you fail, it's a reflection on the problem and not you.

##### Being glue

* Staff engineers often do the needed, but often invisible, tasks to keep the team moving forward and shipping its work.

##### But will you still write software?

* Staff engineers don't write as much software as they did earlier in their career.
* If a Staff engineer finds themselves coding often, it's usually a sign of working on something comfortable rather than something important.

##### Slow but rewarding

* Most of the work you'll be doing at this level replaces the feedback loop with one that takes weeks, months, and years.

#### Does the title even matter?

* Three consistent advantages that generally come with being a Staff-plus title are:
  * allowing you to bypass informal gauges of seniority
  * facilitating access to "the room"
  * increase in current and career compensation

##### Informal gauges of seniority

* A Staff-plus title allows you to re-invest the energy you've previously spent on proving yourself into the core work you're evaluated on.

##### Being in the room

* In more senior roles, you can provide input when it's relatively cheap to incorporate, because the roll out or implementation has not advanced too far.

##### Compensation

* Even if your current company doesn't compensate for Staff-plus engineer roles much differently than for Senior engineer roles, some companies do.

##### Access to interesting work

* Being a Staff-plus engineer does not necessarily give you access to interesting work. For example, as a tech lead you may be undermining your team if you operate that way.
* The most consistently effective way to get access to interesting work is being hired to do it.
* As a Staff engineer, you cannot pursue interesting work out of personal interest – you must put the business' needs first, and to model good behavior.

##### Different rather than better

* Many folks find that their Staff role's heightened expectations eliminate the work that used to excite them.

##### Material but not magic

* If you have a problem and believe that your title is the only thing holding you back, rest assured that focusing on developing your approach and skills will be far more impactful than the title.
* However, women and minorities often do find they spend significantly less time and energy proving themselves once they attain a Staff-plus title.

### Operating at Staff

* A big part of the learning curve of Staff engineer is that much of the work you're doing has a much slower feedback cycle.

#### Work on what matters

* If you're continuing to advance your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing.
* Only through pacing your career to your life can you sustain yourself in the long term.

##### Avoiding snacking

* When you run out of easy and high-impact work, only hard and high-impact work or easy and low-impact work is left. The latter choice is *snacking*.
* In senior roles, you're more likely to self-determine your work. If you're not deliberately tracking your work then it's easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.

##### Stop preening

* Preening is the seductive subset of snacking that is low-impact, high-visibility work.
* Many companies can't distinguish between preening and impact, leading senior engineers to do work of dubious value that is frequently recognized in company meetings.
* To be a successful preener requires near invulnerability to criticism of your actual impact, and your true work will suffer if your energy is diverted to preening.

##### Stop chasing ghosts

* After joining a new company, taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results.

##### Existential issues

* Companies operate in an eternal iterative elimination tournament, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present.
* If you're about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there.

##### Work where there's room _and_ attention

* The most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work.
* Teaching a company to value something it doesn't care about is the hardest soft of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less.

##### Foster growth

* If you start dedicating a few hours per week to developing the team around you, it's quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.

##### Edit

* With your organizational privilege, relationships, and ability to see around corners derived from your experience, you can often shift a project's outcomes by investing the smallest amount of effort.

##### Finish things

* We only get value from finishing projects, and getting a project over the finish line is the magical moment it goes from risk to leverage.

##### What only you can

* The final category of work that matters is the work you're uniquely capable of accomplishing, which is an intersection of what you're exceptionally good at and what you genuinely care about.

##### Why it matters

* Interviewing judges you on subjective measures like your accumulated prestige, your titles at companies you've worked at, your backchannel reputation, and how you present yourself in the interview process.
* The only viable long-term bet on your career is focusing on work that matters, doing projects that develop you, and steering yourself toward companies that value genuine experience.

#### Writing engineering strategy

* To write an engineering strategy, write five design documents and pull the similarities out. That's your engineering strategy.
* To write an engineering vision, write five engineering strategies, and forecast their implications two years into the future. That's your engineering vision.
* Engineering strategy and vision are the output of iterative, bottom-up organizational learning.

##### When and why

* If you're rehashing the same discussion multiple times, it's time to write an engineering strategy.
* When the future's too hazy to identify investments worth making, it's time to write another vision.

##### Write five design docs

* A batch of design docs is the ideal ingredient for writing an effective strategy because they have what bad strategies lack: detailed specifics grounded in reality.
* A few recommendations as you write:
  * Prefer minimal design document templates that allow authors to select the most useful sections and only insist on exhaustive details for the riskiest projects.
  * Gather perspectives widely but write alone. Don't fall in love with what you've written until *after* you've reviewed it with others.
  * Focusing on pushing designs to be good, rather than fixating on your own best as the relevant quality bar.

##### Synthesize those five design docs into a strategy

* Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain the rationale behind that guidance. Bad strategies set policy without explanation.
* Some advice for writing a strategy document:
  * Be specific, and if you can't be specific, wait until you've written more design documents. Specific statements create alignment.
  * Be opinionated, or else the document won't provide any clarity on decision making.
  * Show the rationale behind your opinions, so that others can modify and extend your work as the underlying context shifts.

##### Extrapolate five strategies into a vision

* Some advice for writing a useful vision:
  * Write two to three years out, or expand a bit longer if you're at a fairly-established company.
  * Ground it in serving your business and your users. Bad visions are grounded in technical sophistication, which isn't aligned with leadership's goals.
  * Be ambitious but not audacious. Write what you could do if every project finished on time, and not what would be possible with unlimited resources.
  * Stay concrete and specific. Details in visions are often illustrative rather than declarative, giving a taste of a future rather than a binding commitment.

#### Managing technical quality

* At a well-run and successful company, most of your previous technical decisions won't meet your current quality threshold.
* Rather than a failure, closing the gap between your current and target technical quality is a routine, essential part of effective engineering leadership.

##### The problem

* As an engineering leadership team, you must maintain an appropriate technical quality level while devoting as much energy as possible towards the core business.
* Technical quality is a long-term game. You don't win, but instead learn and earn the chance to keep playing.

##### Ascending the staircase

* When thinking of quality improvements, start with the lightest weight solutions and only progress toward massive solutions as earlier efforts fail to scale.
* If something isn't working, try for a bit to make it work, and then embrace its demise.

##### Hot spots

* It's more important to understand the problem at hand and try to fix it than to create process-driven accountability.
* Adopt the performance engineer's mindset, whereby you measure the problem at hand, identify where the bulk of the issue occurs, and focus on precisely that area.
* When the organization is creating quality problems faster than you can fix hot spots, move on to adopting best practices.

##### Best practices

* When rolling out a new practice, don't rush. Instead roll out the process to a few engaged teams, make adjustments, and then roll it out further.
* Channel all your energy toward making one best practice a success rather than dividing resources across multiple best practices that are rolling out concurrently.
* Adopting a single best practice at a time also forces you to prioritize.
* Transitioning from best practices to leverage points happens when you find yourself wanting to adopt a new best practice before your in-progress best practice is working.

##### Leverage points

* Leverage points are places where extra investment preserves quality over time, both by preventing gross quality failures and reducing the cost of future quality investments.
* Impactful leverage points include designing interfaces that hide complexity, and data models that are rigid but still support evolution.
* A key advantage of investing in leverage points is that you don't need total organizational alignment to do it.
* If you've exhausted the accessible impact from leverage points, it may be time to move on to driving broader organizational alignment.

##### Technical vectors

* Effective organizations marshal the majority of their efforts toward a shared vision.
* Routing all technical decisions through an Architect aligns technical direction, but this is challenging to scale.
* Your fundamental tools for aligning technical vectors are:
  * Giving direct feedback to the individuals who you believe are misaligned.
  * Encapsulating your approach in your workflows and tooling. This nurtures habits far better than training or documentation.
  * Training new members during their onboarding. Pointing them in the right direction starts them from a position of alignment.
* If none of the techniques above are enough, you may require heavier approaches, and the first step is always measurement.

##### Measure technical quality

* The more detailed your definition of quality, the more useful it becomes to measure a codebase, and the more instructive it is to folks hoping to improve quality.
* You must have a precise and measurable definition. And then you must have instrumentation to create a quality score that you can track over time.
* After defining and instrumenting quality, you must choose between investing in a *quality team* or a *quality program*.

##### Technical quality team

* This team's goal is to create and preserve quality across your company's software.
* Start with a small team of three to six folks, thereby forcing you to prioritize their roadmap on impact and maintain focus on the achieveable.
* As a rule of thumb, consider one engineer working on developer tooling for every fifteen product engineers, in addition to your infrastructure investment.
* Some fundamentals for success for such teams:
  * Trust metrics over intuition.
  * Adoption and usability of your tools are much more important than raw power, so do user research on your tools and listen to and learn from your users.
  * Do fewer things, but do them better.
* Your quality team should have more high-impact work than you can take on. If that's not the case, then you aren't thinking broadly enough.
* If there is critical quality work that you cannot get to, then explore starting a quality program.

##### Technical quality program

* A quality program is an initiative led by a dedicated team to maintain technical quality across an organization.
* The core approach is:
  * Identify a program sponsor. This must be a powerful person who can change the constraints of an organization, thereby allowing a change in behavior.
  * Generate sustainable, reproducible metrics.
  * Identify program goals for every impacted team, and then serve as a subject matter expert to provide a clear path to achieving them.
  * Build tools and documentation to support teams toward their goals. Do as much as possible to avoid teams having to deeply understand the problem space you're attempting to make progress in.
  * Create a goal dashboard and share it widely. For each team, this dashboard should be a scorecard and provide breadcrumbs for where to focus next.
  * Send programmatic nudges to folks behind on their goals. Ensure they are helpful or else they will be forever ignored.
  * Periodically review program status with your sponsor. Leveraging your sponsor to bridge misaligned prioritization is essential to your success.
* Keep your program lean enough to cancel, and remain self-critical enough to cancel it if it ceases driving quality creation.

##### Start small and add slowly

* With complex systems and interdependencies, moving quickly is just optics. Methodical movement gets the job done.

#### Stay aligned with authority

* Retaining organizational authority depends on remaining deeply aligned with a bestowing sponsor – generally your direct manager.

##### Beyond the safety net

* Staff-plus roles are leadership roles, and in leadership roles, the support system that got you there will fade away.

##### Serving at the pleasure of the President

* In a Staff-plus role, authority flows from your tight association with greater authority.
* In previous roles, your authority primarily accumulates through your personal actions and impact over time.
* To align with your manager:
  * Never surprise your manager. Nothing destroys trust faster than this, and it calls into question whether you're taking responsibility for your organization.
  * Don't let your sponsor surprise you. If they don't actively communicate information relevant to your work, take action to facilitate information flow.
  * Feed your manager's context. Be clear that you're not bringing them problems to solve, but rather conveying information you believe will be useful.
* Managing up is about increasing bandwidth and reducing friction between you and your manager.

##### Influencing without too much friction

* Make the distinction between the values you hold and those the organization operates under, and find a way to advocate for the former without getting kicked out of the room.

#### To lead, you have to follow

* Management is a specific profession, but leadership is a trait one can demonstrate within any profession.
* Leaders both:
  * Can define the gap between how things are and how they ought to be, and can identify proactive and congruent solutions to narrow that gap.
  * Care enough about the gap to attempt those narrowing actions.
* The most effective leaders spend more time following than they do leading. In practice this means:
  * Be clear with yourself on what your true priorities are, and don't dilute yourself across everything that comes up.
  * Give support quickly to others who are working to make improvements. Someone trustworthy leading a project will almost always get to a good outcome.
  * Make your feedback explicitly non-blocking.
* You must incorporate your worldview into those of people around you, accelerating overall progress around you even if it means detouring from your vision.
